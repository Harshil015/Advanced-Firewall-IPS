# 🔥 Advanced Linux Firewall & Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

A Bash-driven Linux firewall built on iptables that implements stateful packet inspection, honeyport-based intrusion detection, and automated IP banning.  
This project demonstrates practical Blue-Team and Purple-Team skills in host-level defense and automated threat response.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on strengthening host security by actively monitoring and filtering network traffic. 
It detects suspicious behavior such as port scans and brute-force attempts, then dynamically applies defensive rules to block attackers.

The goal is to showcase how Linux firewalls can be tuned beyond basic filtering to provide real-time intrusion prevention.
